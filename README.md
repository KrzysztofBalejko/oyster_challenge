**Exercise from Makers Academy**
-------------------------------
The aim of this challenge was to build a complex system, stretch our skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design. It was a pair-programming exercise and each day
I would pair with different person working on different versions of this project.

By participating I wanted to achieve the following objective goals:

**I write code that is easy to change**

Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster

**I can test-drive my code**

Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.

**I can build with objects**

Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.
